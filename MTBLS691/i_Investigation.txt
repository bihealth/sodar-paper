Investigation Title	Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center
Investigation Description	The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC) is a transdisciplinary malaria systems biology research program initially supported by an NIH/NIAID contract (# HHSN272201200031C, 2012-2017; see http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu). The MaHPIC continues with ongoing support from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) and others. The MaHPIC generates many data types (e.g., clinical, hematological, parasitological, metabolomics, functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response, telemetry) and mathematical models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates (NHPs), and metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.

Study Title	MaHPIC Experiment E03 - Quantitative Metabolomics of Macaca mulatta infected with Plasmodium coatneyi Hackeri strain to produce and integrate clinical, hematological, parasitological, and omics measures of acute, recrudescent, and chronic infections.
Study Description	<b>MaHPIC Experimental Description:</b><br/> Malaria-naive male rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), approximately four years of age, were inoculated intravenously with salivary gland sporozoites produced and isolated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from multiple <i>Anopheles</i> species (<i>An. dirus, An. gambiae</i>, and <i>An. stephensi</i>) and then profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, lipidomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment was designed for 100 days, and pre- and post-100 day periods to prepare subjects and administer curative treatments respectively. The anti-malarial drug artemether was subcuratively administered to all subjects at the initial peak of infection, one out of the five macaques received four additional subcurative treatments for subsequent recrudescence peaks. The experimental infection in one subject was ineffective but the macaque was followed-up for the same period of 100 days. The different clinical phases of the infection were clinically determined for each subject. Blood-stage curative doses of artemether were administered to all subjects at the end of the study. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of CBCs, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at seven time points for functional genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and immunological analyses.<br/><br/>Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as ‘Experiment 03’. This dataset was produced by Dr. Regina Cordy and Manoj Khadka at Emory University.

This page will be updated as datasets are released to the public. The experimental design and protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). <br/><br/><b>Complete list of dataset contributors:</b><br/>The MaHPIC Consortium, Jeremy D.
